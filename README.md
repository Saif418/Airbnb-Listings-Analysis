# Airbnb-Listings-Analysis
In this Project I am analyzing 3 cities and its Airbnb Listings to predict the price based on the area, room type (Private room, Home/Apt, Hotels, Shared Rooms), and property type (studio, 1 bedroom, etc.). I have cleaned 3 datasets totaling over 130K rows worth of data and used different types of Machine Learning models to check the accuracy of my Predictions.
Used an ETL pipeline (Extract Transform Load) to transform data and loaded it on a SQLite DB for further Machine Learning analysis. Then using Gradio made a little UI for testing the predictions.
