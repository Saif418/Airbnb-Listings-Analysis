# Airbnb-Listings-Analysis
In this Project I am analyzing 3 cities and its Airbnb Listings to predict the price based on the area, room type (Private room, Home/Apt, Hotels, Shared Rooms), and property type (studio, 1 bedroom, etc.). I have cleaned 3 datasets totaling over 130K rows worth of data and used different types of Machine Learning models to check the accuracy of my Predictions.
